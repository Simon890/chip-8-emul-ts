## Purpose

The main goal of this project was **learning and exploration**. It was built as a way to:

- Deepen my understanding of low-level architecture and virtual machines.
- Practice TypeScript and apply object-oriented design patterns.
- Learn how to handle binary operations, memory management, and instruction decoding.

## What is CHIP-8?

CHIP-8 is a simple, interpreted programming language developed in the 1970s to allow video games to be easily programmed on early microcomputers. It's widely used as a learning tool for emulator development due to its simplicity and small instruction set.

## Features

- Full instruction set support for the CHIP-8 specification.
- 64x32 monochrome display with HTML5 Canvas rendering.
- Built-in keypad mapping for keyboard input.
- Timer and sound support.
- Load and run CHIP-8 ROMs in the browser.
- Simple, modular architecture.
